## Introduction:

The codes solve 1D heat equation with different finite difference schemes. 
The code heat_equation_1D_ftcs_scheme.m uses the forward-time central-space scheme.
The code heat_equation_1D_btcs_scheme.m uses the backward-time central-space scheme.
The code heat_equation_1D_cn_scheme_example_1.m - heat_equation_1D_cn_scheme_example_4.m use the Crank-Nicolson scheme.

## Requirement:
Any version of Matlab

## Implementation details and running

You may download them and run directly.
